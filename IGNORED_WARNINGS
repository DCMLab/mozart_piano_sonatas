INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 247) ms3.Corpus.mozart_piano_sonatas.K284-3
	Warning appears because MC 247 stands in 2/2 and is an incomplete final measure with length of a half note, 
	whereas MC 248 is the beginning of a new variation and has (only) a quarter note upbeat in 3/4.

INCORRECT_VOLTA_MN_WARNING (2, 13) ms3.Parse.mozart_piano_sonatas.K311-2 
	Complaint: MC 13, the 1st measure of a 2nd volta, should have MN 1, not MN 12.
	Justification: In order to include the |EC}{ for the repetition of m. 1 we had to introduce first and second endings that are not
	in the print. Hence it is correct that volta 1 is m. 1 and volta 2 is m. 12.

INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 176) ms3.Corpus.mozart_piano_sonatas.K311-3 
	MC 176 is a 3/8 upbeat measure after a cadenza (encoded as two bars with irregular lengths) within 6/8.
