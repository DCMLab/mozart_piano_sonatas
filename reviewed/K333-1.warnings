Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 35, '0', 'vii7') ms3.Parse.mozart_piano_sonatas.K333-1 --
	The label 'vii7' in m. 34, onset 0 (MC 35, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Bb.V, it expresses the scale degrees ('7', '2', '#4', '6') [('E', 'G', 'B', 'D')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
