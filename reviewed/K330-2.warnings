DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 44, '0', '#viio(64)') ms3.Parse.mozart_piano_sonatas.K330-2 --
	The label '#viio(64)' in m. 39, onset 0 (MC 44, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of F.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('#7', '3', '5') [('E', 'Ab', 'C')].
	The corresponding score segment has 3 within-label and 6 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
