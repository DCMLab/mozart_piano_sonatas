Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 11, '1/2', 'V') ms3.Parse.mozart_piano_sonatas.K284-2 --
	The label 'V' in m. 11, onset 1/2 (MC 11, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of A.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('5', '7', '2') [('E', 'G#', 'B')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.8 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
